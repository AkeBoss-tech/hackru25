# Snapshot Analysis & Family Member Management Features

This document describes the enhanced snapshot analysis system that integrates sex offender detection and family member management with automatic snapshot processing.

## üö® **New Features**

### **1. Automatic Snapshot Analysis**
- **Every snapshot taken is automatically analyzed** for sex offenders and family members
- **Real-time detection** when snapshots are captured during object detection
- **Integrated with existing timeline system** - no additional setup required
- **Console logging** with detailed offender information

### **2. Sex Offender Detection on Snapshots**
- **Automatic detection** whenever a snapshot is captured
- **High-confidence alerts** with detailed offender information
- **Console output** with offender details:
  ```
  üö® SEX OFFENDER DETECTED in snapshot event_123: 2 matches
  ```
- **Web interface alerts** for critical detections

### **3. Family Member Management System**
- **Add family members** with photos in the Settings tab
- **Upload photos** of family members for recognition
- **Capture current frame** button for live family member enrollment
- **Family member database** with persistent storage
- **Automatic recognition** in snapshots

### **4. Enhanced Web Interface**

#### **Settings Tab Enhancements:**
- **Sex Offender Detection Controls:**
  - Enable/disable continuous detection
  - Confidence threshold slider (0.1 - 1.0)
  - Detection interval slider (1-10 seconds)
  - Start/Stop detection buttons

- **Family Member Management:**
  - Add family member name and photo
  - Upload photos for recognition
  - Capture current frame for enrollment
  - View and remove family members
  - Refresh family member list

#### **Notifications Tab Enhancements:**
- **Sex Offender Alerts Section:**
  - Real-time alerts for detected sex offenders
  - Confidence scores and offender details
  - Timestamp information
  - Clear alerts functionality

- **Family Member Detection Section:**
  - Real-time notifications when family members are detected
  - Detection history
  - Clear detections functionality

## üîß **How It Works**

### **Automatic Snapshot Analysis Flow:**
1. **Object Detection** triggers snapshot capture
2. **Timeline Manager** saves snapshot to disk
3. **Snapshot Analysis Service** automatically analyzes the snapshot:
   - Detects faces in the image
   - Runs sex offender detection on each face
   - Checks for family member matches
   - Logs results to console
4. **Web Interface** receives real-time updates via WebSocket
5. **Alerts** are displayed for high-confidence matches

### **Console Output Example:**
```
üîç Analyzing snapshot: timeline_snapshots/20241215_143025_event_123_annotated.jpg
üö® SEX OFFENDER DETECTED in snapshot event_123: 1 matches
üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ FAMILY MEMBER detected in snapshot event_123: 1 matches
‚úÖ Snapshot analysis complete: 1 sex offenders, 1 family members
```

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Snapshot Analysis:**
```bash
# Test with uploaded image
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/snapshot/analyze \
  -F "image=@test_image.jpg"
```

### **Test Family Member Management:**
```bash
# Add family member
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/family/analysis/members \
  -F "name=John Doe" \
  -F "photo=@family_photo.jpg"
```

### **Test Sex Offender Detection:**
```bash
# Start detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/sex_offender_detection/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"camera_index": 0, "confidence_threshold": 0.3, "detection_interval": 2.0}'
```

## üîí **Security Considerations**

- **Data Privacy**: All analysis is performed locally
- **Family Photos**: Stored securely in local directory
- **Access Control**: Web interface should be secured in production
- **Logging**: Sensitive information should be filtered from logs

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

- **Face Recognition**: Implement actual face recognition for family members
- **Database Integration**: Store detection history in database
- **Mobile App**: Mobile interface for family member management
- **Email Alerts**: Email notifications for critical detections
- **Video Recording**: Automatic video recording when sex offenders detected

## üìû **Support**

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify camera and database setup
3. Test with provided API endpoints
4. Review configuration settings
